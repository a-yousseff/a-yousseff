👨‍💻 Passionate Coder | 🏍️ Diver & Motorcycle Enthusiast | 🌍 Globe-Trotter | 🇪🇬 Egyptian Native with a 🇨🇭 Swiss Pass

Hey there! I'm a tech enthusiast whose life revolves around coding, exploring the depths of the ocean, cruising on two wheels, and traversing the globe. Born and raised in the heart of Egypt, I've found a second home in Switzerland, thanks to my Swiss Pass, which symbolizes not just my love for travel but also my connection to a place that shares my passion for precision, quality, and innovation.

### What I Do
- 💻 **Tech Wizardry**: From front-end to back-end, and everything in between, I love crafting solutions that make life easier and more interesting. I'm always on the lookout for the next challenge and the next problem to solve.
- 🌊 **Diving Deep**: When I'm not coding, I'm probably underwater, exploring another world that reminds me how vast and varied our planet is.
- 🏍️ **Motorcycle Adventures**: There's nothing quite like the freedom of hitting the road on my bike, feeling the wind, and experiencing the world at a different pace.
- 🌍 **Wanderlust**: With every trip, whether it's within the borders of Egypt or beyond, I seek to learn, adapt, and grow. My Swiss Pass is not just a travel document; it's a key to experiences, cultures, and memories.

### Connect With Me
Whether you're a fellow coder, a diving buddy, a road warrior, or a globetrotter, I believe we can share stories, experiences, and perhaps even collaborate on a project or an adventure. Let's connect and explore the possibilities the world has to offer!
